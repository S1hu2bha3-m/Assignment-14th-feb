    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby reducing the overall execution time.\n",
    "Resource sharing: Multithreading allows multiple threads to share the same resources, such as memory or CPU time, which can be more efficient than allocating separate resources for each thread.\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to continue processing user input or other events while performing long-running tasks in the background.\n",
    "Better use of resources: Multithreading can help to make better use of available resources, such as CPU time, by allowing multiple threads to execute on the same processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex than single-threaded programs, and it can be difficult to manage the interactions between threads.\n",
    "Synchronization: Multithreaded programs require careful synchronization of shared resources to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues.\n",
    "Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead, such as the cost of creating and managing threads, which can reduce the performance benefits of using multiple threads.\n",
    "Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more difficult than debugging single-threaded programs, as the behavior of one thread can affect the behavior of other threads."

    "Ans. Both deadlocks and race conditions are types of concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked and unable to proceed because each thread is waiting for the other thread to release a resource. This can occur when two threads acquire resources in different orders, leading to a circular dependency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when the behavior of a program depends on the timing of events, and the order of events is not guaranteed. In other words, the outcome of a program can be influenced by which thread happens to execute first."
